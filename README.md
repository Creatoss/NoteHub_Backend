# On my way to understand topics about backend dev with Express.js

This is a personal project built with **Express.js** to understand web development topics.  
It is a backend application that uses **MongoDB** for data storage and implements **authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.  
The project is still in development as I continue learning and improving it.

## Features

- Learning-focused project to understand backend concepts
